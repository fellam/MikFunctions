== Dependencies ==

This extension was developed for MediaWiki 1.17 with at least Semantic
MediaWiki 1.5.3 and Semantic Forms 2.4 installed. Other version might work, but
are not tested.

=======
== Installation ==

1. Download the package. Unpack the folder inside /extensions (so that the files
   are in /extensions/MikFunctions, rename the folder if necessary).
   
2. Create a directory named "'''seqences'''" in the extension folder 
   and grant write permissions for the wiki directory owner.  

	Example on linux: 
		mkdir ../extensions/MikFunctions/sequences;
		chown apache:apache ../extensions/MikFunctions/sequences;

3. In your LocalSettings.php, add the following line to the end of the file:

   require_once("$IP/extensions/MikFunctions/MikFunctions.php");
